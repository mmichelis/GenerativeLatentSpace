# The Latent Space of Generative Models



## Repository Structure


### Models

The models found here are all independently/separately trainable by executing the files. After training is finished, a trained model will be stored in `TrainedModels/`. Files should be called within the main `GenerativeLatentSpace` parent-directory. Training progress can be monitored in `Outputs/`.
